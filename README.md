### Hi, I'm Lauren :sparkles:

#### I'm a VP of Engineering with a passion for AI and developing innovative tools that empower software engineers. :computer:

I'm most excited about the intersection of NLP and engineering solutions, with a current focus on leveraging NLP to build systems that improve web accessibility for people of all abilities.

In my spare time, I love experimenting with mobile app development and diving into the latest models and datasets from Hugging Face.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming :video_game:, hanging out with my cats :cat: and dog :dog:, sipping coffee :coffee:, or enjoying the great outdoors :mountain:.
